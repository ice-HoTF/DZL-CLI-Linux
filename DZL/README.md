**Add DZL as a Application Entry and Open it as an Application** 
\
This is automatically done through the <install_DZL.sh> script, but this is how you do it manually:
\
\
1: Copy <DZL.desktop> to /home/$USER/.local/share/applications/ and in the Terminal:
\
cp /home/$USER/DZL-Beta-Linux-main/DZL.desktop /home/$USER/.local/share/applications/DZL.desktop
\
\
2: Copy the .png-icon to the </usr/share/icons> folder in the Terminal:
\
sudo cp /home/$USER/DZL-Beta-Linux-main/DZL/dzl.png /usr/share/icons/
\
\
\
\
**FAQ:**
\
\
I can't join the server:
- Restart Steam if you can't join the server and try again.
- On heavily modded servers, steam once in a while glitches right after downloading the mods and. A steam restart solves it.
